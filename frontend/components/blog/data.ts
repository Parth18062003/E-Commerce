      <div class="prose max-w-none px-4 py-8">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">As the fashion industry grapples with its environmental impact, streetwear brands are leading the charge toward sustainability. Traditional streetwear, known for its bold graphics and casual aesthetic, is now embracing eco-friendly materials and ethical production practices. In this article, we’ll explore how brands are making sustainability a priority.</p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Eco-Friendly Materials</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">Brands are increasingly using innovative materials such as organic cotton, recycled polyester, and plant-based leathers. These materials reduce the environmental footprint compared to traditional fabrics. For example, organic cotton is grown without harmful pesticides, while recycled polyester is made from post-consumer plastic bottles.</p>
        <div class="w-full flex items-center justify-center mb-6 relative h-64 rounded-lg overflow-hidden">
          <Image src="https://plus.unsplash.com/premium_photo-1661368421663-13b2d8115241?w=500&auto=format&fit=crop&q=60&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8MXx8ZWNvJTIwZnJpZW5kbHl8ZW58MHx8MHx8fDA%3D" alt="Eco-Friendly Materials" class="object-cover w-1/2 h-64" />
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Ethical Production</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">Beyond materials, brands are focusing on fair labor practices. This includes ensuring that workers are paid fair wages and work in safe conditions. Ethical production also involves minimizing waste through circular fashion initiatives, such as recycling and upcycling programs.</p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Consumer Demand</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">Consumers are also driving the shift towards sustainability. Many shoppers are demanding transparency from brands and supporting those that align with their values. Social media has played a crucial role in raising awareness about sustainable fashion practices and holding brands accountable.</p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Leading Brands</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">Several brands are at the forefront of sustainable streetwear. Patagonia and Stella McCartney have long been committed to sustainability, and they continue to innovate in this space. Newer brands like Veja and Kering are also making significant strides in creating eco-friendly streetwear.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-lg">
          <li>Patagonia: Known for its recycled materials and fair trade practices.</li>
          <li>Stella McCartney: A pioneer in vegan and cruelty-free fashion.</li>
          <li>Veja: Uses organic cotton and sustainable rubber for its sneakers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">The future of streetwear is green, and it’s inspiring to see how the industry is evolving to meet the challenges of our time. By embracing eco-friendly materials and ethical production practices, brands are not only reducing their environmental impact but also setting a positive example for the broader fashion industry. As consumers, we can support this movement by choosing sustainable options and demanding more from the brands we love.</p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Combining vintage and modern pieces is a surefire way to create a unique and timeless wardrobe. The key is to strike a balance between old and new, allowing each piece to complement the other. In this style guide, we’ll provide tips for mixing vintage and modern outfits.</p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Start with a Statement Vintage Item</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">Begin with a standout vintage piece, such as a 70s blazer, a 90s band tee, or a classic leather jacket. These items serve as the foundation of your outfit and add a touch of nostalgia.</p>
        <div class="w-full flex items-center justify-center mb-6 relative h-64 rounded-lg overflow-hidden">
          <Image src="https://plus.unsplash.com/premium_photo-1675186049547-2842e30f12e6?w=500&auto=format&fit=crop&q=60&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8NXx8bGVhdGhlciUyMGphY2tldHxlbnwwfHwwfHx8MA%3D%3D" alt="Vintage Blazer" class="object-cover w-1/2 h-64" />
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Pair with Contemporary Basics</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">Balance your vintage piece with modern basics like slim-fit jeans, sleek sneakers, or tailored trousers. This contrast creates a look that’s both nostalgic and fresh. For example, a vintage denim jacket paired with black leather pants and white sneakers is a stylish and versatile combination.</p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Use Accessories to Blend Eras</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">Accessories are another great way to blend vintage and modern styles. A vintage leather bag, retro sunglasses, or a classic watch can add character to a modern outfit. Mix patterns, textures, and styles to create unexpected and exciting combinations.</p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Experiment and Have Fun</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">Don’t be afraid to experiment with different combinations. Fashion is about self-expression, so have fun and let your personality shine through. You can mix and match items from different decades to create a truly unique look.</p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Examples</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-lg">
          <li><strong>Vintage Denim Jacket + Modern Leather Pants + White Sneakers</strong></li>
          <li><strong>80s Windbreaker + Skinny Jeans + High-Top Sneakers</strong></li>
          <li><strong>70s Graphic Tee + Tailored Trousers + Loafers</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">Mixing vintage and modern pieces is a fun and creative way to express your personal style.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Introduction</h2>
      <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Sneakers are more than just footwear—they’re an investment. Whether you’re a collector or just a casual wearer, taking care of your sneakers is essential to keep them looking fresh and extend their lifespan. In this article, we’ll share expert tips on sneaker care.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Cleaning Your Sneakers</h2>
      <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">Regular cleaning is the first step to maintaining your sneakers. Use a soft brush or cloth to remove dirt and debris. For deeper cleaning, mix mild soap with water and gently scrub the surface. Avoid using harsh chemicals, as they can damage the material.</p>
      <div class="w-full flex items-center justify-center mb-6 relative h-64 rounded-lg overflow-hidden">

      </div>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Drying and Storage</h2>
      <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">After cleaning, let your sneakers air dry naturally. Avoid direct heat, as it can warp the material. Store them in a cool, dry place, and use shoe trees or stuff them with paper to maintain their shape.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Protecting Your Sneakers</h2>
      <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">To protect your sneakers from stains and water damage, consider applying a protective spray. This is especially useful for suede or canvas sneakers. Rotate your sneakers regularly to prevent excessive wear and tear.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Repair and Maintenance</h2>
      <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">For minor repairs, such as loose stitching or scuffed soles, consider using a sneaker repair kit. For more significant damage, take your sneakers to a professional cobbler. Regular maintenance can significantly extend their lifespan.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">Taking care of your sneakers doesn’t have to be complicated. With a little effort and the right techniques, you can keep your sneakers looking fresh and ensure they last for years to come. Whether you’re a sneakerhead or just a casual wearer, these tips will help you get the most out of your footwear.</p>
