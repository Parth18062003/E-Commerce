Problem Statement: E-Commerce Platform with Microservices and Analytics Dashboard
Objective: Design and implement an e-commerce platform utilizing a microservices architecture, coupled with an analytics dashboard. This solution should showcase your skills in system design, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), and data analytics.

Key Requirements:

E-Commerce Platform Components:

User Service: Manage user registration, authentication, and profiles.
Product Service: Handle product catalog, details, and inventory.
Order Service: Process orders, handle payments, and manage order history.
Cart Service: Manage shopping carts and items.
Payment Service: Process payments and transactions.
Notification Service: Send notifications (emails, SMS) related to orders and promotions.
Analytics Dashboard Components:

Data Collection: Aggregate data from various microservices (e.g., user activity, sales data) and store it in a data warehouse.
Data Processing: Process and aggregate data using a data processing framework.
Dashboard Service: Provide APIs for retrieving processed data.
Frontend: Build a web-based dashboard for visualizing analytics (e.g., sales trends, user activity).
System Architecture:

API Gateway: Route requests to appropriate microservices.
Service Discovery: Implement service registration and discovery.
Configuration Management: Centralize configuration management.
Database: Each microservice should have its own database to ensure decoupling.
Message Broker: Use for inter-service communication and asynchronous processing.
Security: Implement user authentication and authorization.
Tools and Technologies:

Microservices Development:

Framework: Spring Boot (for developing microservices)
Database: PostgreSQL (for relational data), Redis (for caching)
API Gateway: Spring Cloud Gateway or Zuul
Service Discovery: Eureka
Configuration Management: Spring Cloud Config
Message Broker: Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ
Security: OAuth2 with Spring Security
Analytics Dashboard:

Data Warehouse: Amazon Redshift or Google BigQuery
Data Processing: Apache Spark
Dashboard Service: Spring Boot
Frontend Framework: React or Angular
CI/CD Pipeline:

Source Control: GitHub or GitLab
Build Automation: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI
Containerization: Docker
Orchestration: Kubernetes
Deployment: Helm charts for Kubernetes
Testing: JUnit for unit tests, additional tools for integration and end-to-end testing
Monitoring: Prometheus and Grafana
Logging: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
Security: Automated security scans
Detailed CI/CD Pipeline Steps:

Code Commit: Developers push code changes to the repository.
Build: Trigger builds for each microservice and the analytics components.
Test: Run automated unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
Containerization: Build Docker images and push them to a container registry.
Deployment: Deploy Docker containers to a Kubernetes cluster using Helm charts.
Monitoring: Set up alerts and monitoring to track the health of services.
Feedback Loop: Collect logs and metrics for continuous improvement.
This project aims to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of modern system design, CI/CD practices, and data analytics.
